## About
NeoBlock is built to provide a familiar experience for developers who know Roblox, while expanding the possibilities with its own engine design.  
Although still in a private stage, NeoBlock is being designed to support scripting, services, and game creation with a different approach compared to Roblox Studio.

---

## Features
- Simulation of Roblox-like services.
- Game creation using XML-based place definitions.
- Custom scripting syntax based on **C** instead of Lua.
- Focus on stronger anti-cheat mechanisms.
- Designed for extensibility and experimentation.
